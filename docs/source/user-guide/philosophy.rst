Philosophy
==========

Dequindre is built for amateurs and professionals with the most essential 
features in mind. It also functions as a learning tool for those without
the time or resources to setup the requisite architecture for a full-featured 
scheduler.

Inspired by the complexity of Airflow, Dequindre leans heavilty on three
lines of the Zen of Python:

1. Explicit is better than implicit
2. Simple is better than complex
3. Readability counts

From this starting point, Dequindre offers

-  Minimal abstraction
-  No Python dependencies; no third-party bugs
-  Single-container deployment
-  Legible source code; fewer than 1000 lines
-  Fast, dynamic workflow configuration
