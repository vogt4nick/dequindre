Dequindre is built for professionals with the most basic use-cases in
mind. You can install and configure your first pipeline in minutes.
Dequindre makes it easy to configure, test, and deploy workflows. It
also functions as a learning tool for students and professionals without
the time or resources to setup the requisite architecture for a
full-featured scheduler.

Inspired by the complexity of Airflow, Dequindre leans heavilty on three
lines of the Zen of Python:

1. Explicit is better than implicit.
2. Simple is better than complex.
3. Readability counts.

From this starting point, Dequindre offers

-  Minimal abstraction;
-  No Python dependencies; no third-party bugs
-  Single-container deployment
-  Legible source code; fewer than 1000 lines
-  Fast, dynamic workflow configuration
