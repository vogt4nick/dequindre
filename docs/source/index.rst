Dequindre is built for professionals with the most basic use-cases in mind.
You can install and configure your first pipeline in minutes. Dequindre makes
it easy to configure, test, and deploy workflows. It also functions as a
learning tool for students and professionals without the time or resources to
setup the requisite architecture for a full-featured scheduler.

Inspired by the complexity of Airflow, Dequindre leans heavilty on three lines
of the Zen of Python:

1. Explicit is better than implicit.
2. Simple is better than complex.
3. Readability counts.

From this starting point, Dequindre offers

* No Python dependencies; no third-party bugs
* Single-container deployment
* Legible source code; fewer than 1000 lines
* Fast, dynamic configuration
